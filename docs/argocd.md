# Argo CD

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

## How it works

The following diagram shows the high-level architecture of Argo CD:

The main components of Argo CD are:

* **Argo CD Server**: The core component of Argo CD, responsible for managing the desired state of applications in Kubernetes clusters.
* **Argo CD CLI**: A command-line tool for interacting with the Argo CD Server.
* **Argo CD UI**: A web-based user interface for visualizing and managing applications.
* **Applications**: The applications that Argo CD manages, such as Kubernetes deployments, services, and config maps.
* **Repositories**: The source code repositories that contain the desired state of applications, such as Git repositories.

## Key Features

Argo CD provides the following key features:

* **Declarative Configuration**: Argo CD uses a declarative configuration file (e.g. YAML or JSON) to define the desired state of applications.
* **Automated Application Deployment**: Argo CD automatically deploys applications to Kubernetes clusters based on the desired state defined in the configuration file.
* **Sync**: Argo CD continuously monitors the desired state of applications and synchronizes the actual state of the application with the desired state.
* **Rollbacks**: Argo CD provides a simple way to roll back to a previous version of an application if something goes wrong.
* **Webhooks**: Argo CD provides webhooks for triggering deployments and rollbacks.

## Benefits

Argo CD provides the following benefits:

* **Version Control**: Argo CD provides a version control system for applications, allowing you to track changes and roll back to previous versions.
* **Consistency**: Argo CD ensures that the desired state of applications is consistently applied across all environments.
* **Automation**: Argo CD automates the deployment of applications, reducing the risk of human error.
* **Audit Trail**: Argo CD provides an audit trail of all changes made to applications, allowing you to track who made changes and when.

## Getting Started

To get started with Argo CD, follow these steps:

1. Install Argo CD on your Kubernetes cluster.
2. Create a declarative configuration file (e.g. YAML or JSON) that defines the desired state of your application.
3. Apply the configuration file to your cluster using the Argo CD CLI or UI.
4. Argo CD will automatically deploy your application to your cluster.

## Conclusion

Argo CD is a powerful tool for managing the desired state of applications in Kubernetes clusters. It provides a declarative configuration file, automated deployment, and synchronization of applications, as well as rollbacks, webhooks, and an audit trail. By using Argo CD, you can ensure consistency and automation of your application deployments, and reduce the risk of human error.
